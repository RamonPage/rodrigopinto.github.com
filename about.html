    <p>Hi, I am Rodrigo Pinto a brazilian software developer and is so hard to describe myself, but I could summarize it as:</p>
    <blockquote>I am passionate software developer, building better software driven by <a href="http://smallactsmanifesto.org" target="_blank">Small Acts.</a></blockquote>

    <p>I have been working with software development since early 2007. I started my way with Java and when I realized how great Ruby is I moved on to Ruby and I am working with Ruby and Rails since of then.</p>

    <p>I am enthusiast of Coding Dojo, XP, open source, dynamic languages and so many other technologies that make me enjoy coding. I like to  <a href="http://github.com/rodrigopinto">contribute to open source</a> projects always I have time and I attend at some software communities meetups in Rio de Janeiro, as <a href="http://horaextra.org">#horaextra</a>, <a href="http://dojorio.org">Coding Dojo Rio</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrio.org">Ruby on Rio</a>.</p>

    <p>When I am not coding I enjoy longboarding, <a href="http://letras.mus.br/candeia/">listening to a good Samba</a>, travelling, to cook homemade burguer's, hang out with friends, to meet new people and I like to fishing too.</p>
