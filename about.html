  <p>Hi dude!</p>
  <p>My name is Rodrigo Pinto, I am brazilian software developer and is so hard to describe yourself, but i could say about me that I am:</p>
      <blockquote>A passionate software developer, building better software driven by <a href="http://smallactsmanifesto.org">Small Acts.</a></blockquote>
      <p>
        I am enthusiast of Coding Dojo, XP, open source, dynamic languages and so many other technologies that make me enjoy coding.<br/>
        I attend at some software communities in Rio de Janeiro as <a href="http://horaextra.org">#horaextra</a>, <a href="http://dojorio.org">Coding Dojo Rio</a>, <a href="http://rubyonrio.org">Ruby on Rio</a> and few other.</p>

      <p>I have been working with software development since early 2007. I started my way with Java and when I realized how great Ruby is I moved on to Ruby and I am working with Ruby and Rails since of then.</p>
      <p>As my personal profile I really enjoy to listen to Samba and to hang out with people. I love the sea specially to fishing. I also like to hangout with people, travel and code.</p>
